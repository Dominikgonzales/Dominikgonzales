        <h1>Contract</h1>
        <p>
            I, Dominik J. Gonzales, agree to abide by the terms in my fall 2023 ITIS 3135 Web App Design and Development course with my instructor, D.I. Von Briesen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
        </p>
        <p>Signed:</p>
        <p>Dominik J. Gonzales, 09/11/2001</p>
